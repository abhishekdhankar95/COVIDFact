TCM Formulas for Covid-19 Prophylaxis,"Hi.  I am not a trained TCM practitioner, but I am an enthusiastic amateur student.  With the current pandemic situation, I am interested in what I can do to boost my general well-being and protect myselfand my lungs against respiratory infection by herbal means.   I've already assembled something of a Chinese herb apothecary to deal with any viral infection if it should appear.   I currently have the following TCM formulations:

Gan Mao Ling

Zhong Gan Ling

Sang Ju Yin Wan

Qing Qi Hua Tan Wan

Yin Chiao

Jin Yin Hua tincture

All of these are used to treat lung infection, dispel wind-heat invasion, etc.  I'm curious what TCM practitioners have to say about using any of these formulas for lung support prophylaxis.  Say, if I had to do some shopping, and had to expose myself to possible virus?   Or to take on a daily basis while the virus is active?  Any reason not to take any of these herbal formulas to protect myself against covid-19?

Use of Chinese Traditional Medicine to combat Novel Wuhan Coronavirus

The director of the infection department unveiled the secret anti-epidemic strategy: all confirmed and suspected patients recovered, the hospital's thousand employees had zero infection! Shocking Thunder Yesterday
Tang Ying Top Three Fax
The epidemic situation is still very serious. The top three faxes today shared the experience and practices of a county-level hospital in Henan Province, hoping to bring you some thoughts, references and inspirations. The following is the description of Tang Ying, the director of the infection department of the hospital:
Since January 21, 2020, 25 cases of fever patients returning home have been admitted to our hospital. Among them, 4 were diagnosed, 17 were returned from Wuhan, 6 were in close contact with locals, and 2 were from other regions (where there were confirmed cases). Now 25 people have recovered, 17 people were discharged (including 1 confirmed case), and the other 8 had normal indicators and were in stable condition. They were hospitalized for observation and could be discharged shortly. None of the thousands of employees in our hospital were infected.
As a county hospital, the reason why such achievements can be achieved is due to the study and application of our traditional Chinese medicine. Let us share our insights and experience of this treatment. The overall experience is:
It is not selfish to protect all the medical staff. If the medical staff are all sick, where will the medical staff see the patients?
To ""quick!"" ""Ruthless!"" ""Quasi!"", And strong support from other departments.

According to the six dialectics of Zhang Shengjing's ""Treatment of Febrile and Miscellaneous Diseases"", the plague can quickly damage Sanyang and enter Sanyin. It has repeatedly emphasized that it must be ""quick, ruthless, and accurate"" to defend against failure before it can take the initiative.
details as follows: I. How to protect medical staff from being infected, we have adopted the following measures:
All the staff in the hospital drink Chinese medicine, which is provided free of charge by the hospital and distributed to the department. However, we evaluate the risk of infection by different formulations.
1.	Regarding administrative, logistics, surgical and general medical staff, they do not directly contact patients or fever patients, so they only need to raise the chest yang, so that the yang is sufficient, and the external evils cannot be dried; use licorice Dried ginger soup.
2.	For medical staff in fever clinics, emergency departments, and general fever wards, they directly receive fever patients returning to their hometowns. Therefore, they need to strengthen their protection. On the basis of licorice dried ginger soup, Guizhi Tang plus Poria and Atractylodes . Adjust the balance of yin and yang, remove moisture from the body, and keep them in a balanced state, so they are not easily infected.
3.	The medical staff in the infected area, because they have been dealing with patients for a long time and have close contact, so they need to strengthen their medicine. On the basis of the above two formulas, (1) Medicines for clearing the lungs: Shoot dry ephedra soup. It is based on the consideration that our side is very cold in winter and there is easy to drink water in our lungs. In areas that are not very cold in winter, air conditioning is everywhere in summer. When entering directly from a very hot place to a very cold air-conditioned room, It will also lead to the production of drinking water in the lungs, clearing the drinking water in the lungs, and allowing the blood circulation in the lungs to be unobstructed; (2) If the medical staff has a dry throat, immediately give Gegen Tonga Poria and Atractylodes;
(3) Although the hospital requires half-month rotation, everyone's physical strength is still overdrawn at this stage. At this time, we will give everyone: Fuling Sini Decoction to enhance the yang energy of medical staff.
1.	The medicines dispensed by the above personnel are the basic principles. These medicines are all fried in the pharmacy. Which colleague has any situation, adjust the plan in time, and can take the medicine at any time; this plan has protected more than 1,000 employees in our hospital. Not infected.
In order to do a good job of self-protection, the hospital formulated the famous traditional Chinese medicine's anti-cold medicine prescriptions for free for all the staff in the hospital.
Second, treatment.
Why ""Fast"":
We have studied history from an early age and learned that when the plagues appeared in the past, the infected people may die on the road of reporting injuries, and large areas of villages no longer exist; this time in Wuhan, the number of people infected with new coronary pneumonia increased rapidly. Therefore, the treatment of the plague must be quick.
When the disease suddenly came, we didn't know what to prepare, but as long as the condition required, we would let the patient drink the medicine within 2 hours. In the early days, our night nurses boiled the medicine, and later in the pharmacy.
When a colleague in the pharmacy received a call here: We, a patient, urgently needed this formula. Colleagues in the pharmacy will immediately dispense the medicine into granules and boil them, soaking them for 2 hours without following the normal procedure, and this is a mistake.
When the 120 driver received a call from the pharmacy, someone immediately went to get the medicine, and the driver started the car (our hospital is two hospitals in the south, the Chinese medicine pharmacy was in the north hospital, and our ward was in the south hospital).
Later, for convenience, the dean immediately decided to open the Chinese Medicine Pharmacy of the South Hospital and quickly dispense the required medicines, and arrived at our patients within ten minutes; later, the commonly used medicines must be fried in time. Pay at the nurse's station, as long as the condition requires, let the patient drink.
Why ""ruthless"":
That is to say, the medication must be fierce, because the disease progresses fast, and the fierce medicine must be used to quickly control the progress of the disease. It's like fighting, one move to control the enemy. So we use ephedra, gypsum, pinellia, Zeqi, raw aconite and some other strong medicines.
Why ""quasi"":
There are two levels of meaning here, one is the accuracy of medication; the other is the accuracy of judging the next step in the disease, which reflects the importance and necessity of treating traditional Chinese medicine without disease.
Third, the specific treatment during the treatment of the disease to share with you:
1.	If the body temperature is above 37.8 ℃, give Daqinglong Decoction instead of waiting for high fever. After that, depending on the degree of fever, take a re-serving method ranging from 4--8 hours. Daqinglong Soup: Ephedra 30, Almond 15, Zhigancao 15, Gypsum 20-50, Guizhi 15, Ginger 3 slices, Red Date 60 (that is, 10 dates, cut the dates).
This formula is the first choice for the epidemic of acute respiratory infectious plague: ephedra Xuanfei, main lung fur, ephedra can ensure the unobstructed passage of lung air and skin pores; almonds to replenish cardiopulmonary fluid, gypsum to cool the lungs and protect the lungs from burning Suffocation, cinnamon and jujube strengthen the stomach, and licorice relaxes the heart beat speed.
The amount of medicine used in this prescription is adjusted according to the patient. The plague is fierce and enters quickly. Therefore, the amount of ephedra must be large so that it can be quickly blocked while ensuring that the passage between the lungs and fur is unobstructed. Gypsum must be adjusted according to the course of disease and body temperature. If the course of disease is long or the body temperature is high, the amount is large; if the course of disease is short or the body temperature is not very high, the amount is reduced.
Almond supplements, high body temperature, high consumption, but large amounts. Licorice burns slowly, if the heart is too fast, increase the amount. Ephedra is disabled for those with heart problems! !! !! Switch to Nepeta 15, Windproof 15, Onion 9 instead! !! !!
1.	If the temperature is below 37.8 ℃, give Gegentang plus Poria and Atractylodes.
Pueraria 30, Ephedra 15, Guizhi 15, Baiji 15, Zhigancao 15, 3 slices of ginger, and red date 60.
1.	If there is no change in chest imaging, use Shegan Mahuang Decoction to prevent and prevent the production of water in the lungs; that is, what is called in medicine today, which causes pulmonary edema and inflammation in the lungs.
Shegan ephedra soup recipe: shegan 15, asters 15, winter flowers 15, ephedra 15, asarum 15, schisandra 25, pinellia ternata 25, 3 slices of ginger, red dates 60
1.	If there is a change in chest imaging at the time of admission, immediately give Zeqi Decoction and Poria Sini Decoction. At this time, the strength of Shegan Mahuang Decoction is insufficient. Zeqi Decoction is used to remove the water and phlegm drink in the lungs. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the strength of the heart to stimulate Yang Qi and give Fuling Sini Decoction.
Poria 15, Zhigancao 15, Dried Ginger 15,
Red ginseng 15, raw aconite 10, Ze lacquer 15,
Pinellia 25, Purple Ginseng 25, White before 25,
Scutellaria baicalensis 15, Guizhi 15, 3 slices of ginger
1.	If the patient's coughing sound is turbid, in fact, there is phlegm drinking in the atmospheric tube, then add Qianjin reed stem soup:
Reed root 15, peach kernel 10, winter melon seed 10, coix kernel 30-50
1.	If the patient has an irritating dry cough, water is produced in the compartment, and Linggan Wuwei Jiangxin Banxia Almond Soup is added.
Poria 20, Licorice 15, Schisandra 25, Dried Ginger 15, Asarum 15, Pinellia 25, Almond 15
1.	If the patient is suffering from heat up and cold down, use cannula aconite to warm down the coke appropriately. When the kidney yang is sufficient, the air can be well absorbed.
2.	When the patient has nausea, that is, the disease has entered Shaoyang, and Xiaochaihutang is given plus or minus.
Chaihu 25, Huang Zhi 15, Zhigancao 15, Pinellia 25, Codonopsis 15, 3 slices of ginger, and red date 60 (Ms. Yang discovered early onset of the disease and suffered from Sanyang).
Note: The above are the basic ideas and usage. The specific condition should be added or subtracted as appropriate. It cannot be applied in the original version. When using it, you must follow the doctor's advice. Do not take it by yourself.
The reason why the top three faxes share this article is that at the moment when the virus is raging, it is not easy for a county-level hospital based on western medicine to adopt the traditional Chinese medicine method to fight the epidemic and achieve such a record.
History and reality prove that there is really a set of ""epidemics"" in the battle of Chinese medicine. From the Western Han Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, at least 321 large-scale plagues occurred in China. Chinese medicine and various plagues have begun life-and-death battles again and again, which has limited the spread of the epidemic in a limited area and time. In the history of China, whenever the plague is rampant, there are always Chinese medicine practitioners rushing forward, and there are many Chinese medicines that have been stagnating, and there are countless living people, so this time on the front of the battlefield against new coronavirus, Chinese medicine must not absence!
An open and inclusive internal environment has produced a variety of medical models in China. Since the outbreak of the epidemic, the success of anti-epidemic reports of integrated Chinese and Western medicine has continued to spread. In order to win the fight against epidemics at an early date, and share more successful experiences for frontline medical staff and the general public, with immediate effect, the top three fax calls for cure cases in the fight against new crown pneumonia. It is required to start with a case, narrate the diagnosis and treatment process in detail, and tell the clinical experience and stories of medical staff to fight the new crown in plain language. Types can be traditional Chinese medicine treatment, integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine treatment.

I am so scared about the coronavirus...I don’t want to die before I’ve truly lived (healed from cPTSD with help of psychedelics),"I am so scared about the coronavirus...I don’t want to die before I’ve truly lived (healed from cPTSD with help of psychedelics)


I am so scared about the coronavirus... I have no one to take care of me or bring me food if I get sick due to not having a support system. I recently cut off all toxic relationships including my parents. If I get sick and can’t work for weeks, I won’t have any money which is scary. I can’t afford to stock up on food and supplies just in case.

Also, I am so scared of dying before I have truly started living. I have had cptsd and suffered since I was a child. I have been working so hard on healing and what if I die before I truly started living. I was going to do mdma psychedelic therapy  and ayahuasca in the near future.. what if I died after all the hard work I put into get to that place to heal my ptsd... I haven’t had a healthy romantic relationship, healthy sex, had kids, traveled, and went back to my passionate career yet! There is so much I want to do!

How Essential Oils Prevent and Cure Virus Infection,"I travel to China often,  teaching essential oil courses and developing products for spas there. I had a planned trip rescheduled - good thing. It would have been just at the early stages of the coronavirus. Instead I carryied a flu back from my Boston trip. An essential oil and healthy lifestyle makes my flu pretty moderate (though this one was relentless). 

My friends in China were asking for an antivirus essential oil treatment. I came up with a protocol and sent it through WeChat. Figured, hey, people here and across the globe could use this too. So I posted a blog that gives a detailed method to prevent any virus infection. [https://www.jimmharrison.com/blog/2020/2/5/how-to-prevent-and-cure-virus-infection-with-essential-oils](https://www.jimmharrison.com/blog/2020/2/5/how-to-prevent-and-cure-virus-infection-with-essential-oils)

Basically, because the oils don't get in the cell to destroy a virus, you need to do a constant application of essential oils in the system to catch the virus as it looks for a host cell. Here's how: 

1. Diffuse all day (use a 10 minute on/20 minute off timer)

2. Take 2-3 drops in a capsule once or twice a day (consult a knowing essential oil therapist about this and use authentic essential oils, which overall, you should only use)

3. Massage the entire body twice a day with a good essential oil formula (in a carrier oil). 

Most oils are antiviral. The hot oils, cinnamon, oregano and thyme, are most effective but tricky because they irritate. These are ok in a capsule (I did mention the consulting the essential oil professional). The lemony oils (lemongrass, litsea cubeba and lemon) are very good antiviral. Then there's patchouli, copaiba, geranium, tea tree, eucalyptus radiata, coriander and so many more. Clove and frankincense are good to build immunity. I give a longer list in the blog.

Bloodletting and cupping (wet cupping) questions.,"Background: I currently live in Asia and have been seeing a doctor for weekly allergy shots. His work is a combination of western medicine and acupuncture. My allergies have improved since I started. Back in December, I started getting depressed and anxious (work, missing my family during major holidays, etc.) He put me on western medication. It's only a bandaid, but it helps. 

After this whole coronavirus thing has happened (I'm not in China btw) my school has required all students, teachers and staff to wear a mask at all times. I hate masks for various reasons. The biggest problem is that they give me migraines and pain relievers don't do a whole lot of help. The longer I wear the worse I get. I have tried to rig my mask to wrap around the back of my head instead of around my ears. I have crazy sensitive ears. I can't wear glasses, headphones, ear buds, headbands, earplugs, basically anything that touches my ears. My rigged mask helps some, but I still get headaches. 

I asked my doctor if there was anything to help with this. He recommended bleedletting and cupping. I was a bit nervous about bloodletting because I didn't know it was still a thing. He used a device with needles and stabbed 4 different areas many times. OUCH! Two were between my neck and shoulders (I tense up tons here on a daily basis) and then added the cupping. The other two were behind my ears and he did it manually with his hands because the cups won't fit there.

Strangely, my neck and shoulders were relieved of tension by quite a bit. So far, mostly no more headache, but the skin behind my ears still hurt some.

Questions: I tried to look up information online about this, but didn't find anything useful, especially for this type of issue. Maybe my Google-fu is lacking!  I saw some areas banned licensed acupuncturist from this type of thing (this made me worry about safety issues). Is this still used for certain applications? What exactly is going on and how did this help me?

Herbs That Fight Viruses,"As our world is dealing with the onslaught of COVID-19, let's talk about some herbs that have natural antiviral properties. And the good news is, many of them may already be in your herb garden or cabinet.

This article lists the usual suspects and not only do they fight against viruses, but most of them also offer immune-boosting effects as well. As we all know, the most effective way to keep from getting sick in the first place is to build a strong immunity. So consider beginning to take them before you get sick.

Additional profilactic measures for Covid-19 as well as any virus transmitted via respiratory droplets /contact routine.,"Just some extra measures I was brought up with as a child being a member of traditional doctors +herbalists family. I hope it will be useful to someone as they don't seem to circulate in media:

Washing hands 👐 routine :Yes please and after you washed hands very thoroughly you can wash your FACE with soap and inside your NOSE with isotonic solution (saline solution) or just tar soap. My Nana who was a surgery theatre'nurse used tar soap during all flu seasons for example. 
OIL : Virus is hydrophilic, it's attracted to water in the cells, thus its hard for it to multiply and progress into our respiratory system via mechanical oil barrier. As an extra prevention method we could rub a bit of sweet almond, extra virgin olive,mango, coconut butter etc on Lips and entrance of the nasal passages.
If you could tolerate essential oils enhance carrier oil with eucalyptus or peppermint oil : (upto 5 drops of essential to 10 ml of carrier).
Any viral infection needs a certain ""concentration"" so it procreates successfully, so by doing washing /rinsing /oiling we delay an intruder. 

Do not wear mask outside unless you go for more then 15 minutes in a crowded subway or any other public transport, especially on a windy cool spring day. Please remember that virus does not tolerate UV light-and being on open air, adhering to a reasonable social distance, not touching face or eating outside - for a healthy average human it's extremely unlikely to get sick.
Wearing masks on a windy cold day : our breath is warm, there will be condensation. All water on a mask will start to evaporate, evaporation requires energy, as a result of water evaporation that area around your nose and mouth will become very cold and VERY susceptible to catching viruses and colds.Its counter productive and dangerous. 
It's like being very  cold straight after shower - evaporation will ""draw warmth"" from your body. 
I am not talking about bio hazard mask, respirators with filter in - out etc, just bog standard medical ones-thats everywhere on the streets. 

Do not wear mask unless you are dealing with a sick person, wear them only in a public transport and get rid once you have finished your journey.
Instead of that carry a little bottle of diluted sanitiser like Milton solution for babies and spray your clothes and bag once back from a public place and wipe handles, banisters, intercoms more often - it will do more good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/frse53/additional_profilactic_measures_for_covid19_as/,herbalism,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
Chloroquine to fight covid-19: 1 death in 1003 patients.,"I sent a previous post about plants to help for Covid-19. Now it relates chloroquine if you are interested:

It's been sent 1 hour ago. Didier Raoult released his latest in vivo covid-19 treatment. His team treated 1003 patients in IHU Marseille with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycine . Only 1 death. We waited bigger sample evidence, we know have the confirmation that giving that as soon as people get covid-19 positive reduces mortality rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Roche Director just announced to be convinced by their internal lab tests for Chloroquine and they will give 130 millions dosis to the world:

&amp;#x200B;

Note that there were 1 chinese study showing no big impact compared to a control group (30 people sample) (forbes sended it but that was without azithromycine) and also one previous 80 patients study by Didier Raoult that was less convincing than the numbers he gives now. What the latest 1003 stat shows without doubt is that giving that chloroquine protocol as early as covid tested and assuming we have this strategy in place and we don't wait for the covid-19 to evolve into pneumonia/lung infection/death, then it's confirmed that it reduces mortality rate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/fr6qwn/chloroquine_to_fight_covid19_1_death_in_1003/,herbalism,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

First 2 are massive antiviral with Urtica Dioica agglutinin prevents reproduction of SARS-CoV (nasty brother from the same mother) and protects the lungs from inflammation . Cistus Incanus dampens cytokine storm and Thyme is antitussive for various upper respiratory infections of known and unknown origin.

I hold lungwort (pulmonaria off.) +plantain(plantago major) back for now for an actual cough /atypical pneumonia if it happens.

I think my wormwood supplement just cured my symptoms that line up with covid-19,"I began taking wormwood supplements just when I started to feel symptoms that I’ve never ever had before. My acupuncturist who specializes in CCM recommended it to me because of a parasite. Now I don’t know if there was actually a parasite in my body because I did not go to a doctor but I had some gnarly stomach issues, headaches, major fatigue, sore throat, tightness in my chest, and nightly chills. These are many common symptoms of covid-19. 
Currently the county I live in and in many parts of California are lacking test kits for the virus. In fact before lockdowns were in place I was self -quarantining days before. I definitely was in a bad place... until I started taking wormwood. I’ve taking it ten days in a row, and I already have energy to lightly run again, and do short bouts of exercise. Before, I was struggling to walk to the mailbox. 

I definitely thought it was a combination of the supplements the acupuncturist put me on UNTIL I discovered an interesting piece of research about wormwood...

“Artemisinin is a globally recognized remedy for malaria derived from sweet wormwood, a plant used in TCM. Tu Youyou, the Chinese scientist who turned to ancient Chinese medical texts to find artemisinin, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2015.”
[TCM for Coronavirus ](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/asia/coronavirus-traditional-chinese-medicine-intl-hnk/index.html)

Many research breakthroughs are currently being discovered about how antimalaria medications are helping cure COVID-19. A common ingredient in these medications is artemisinin which I discovered is from wormwood.

Im wondering if that’s the key piece to the puzzle, and my acupuncturist unknowingly gave it to me because I muscle tested that I needed it. I don’t really know about his methodologies behind this but I do know that him prescribing me wormwood possibly saved my life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/fmxui4/i_think_my_wormwood_supplement_just_cured_my/,herbalism,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
Citizen Science Herbal Medicine Data Gathering for COVID-19!," Hello everyone! Hope you are all well. Today I had an idea to create a public data chart to gather data on herbal medicine treatment of those who are confirmed to have COVID or are exhibiting the symptoms of COVID. The link is below. 

I am not a scientist, nor an experienced herbalist, but I believe you can use data to find stories. I'm curious to find out if some treatments are more effective than others. The dominant Western medical system is not collecting this data and its hard to know what plants are most effective right now. My goal is to find out if any herb/tincture singles or combinations are effective at reducing the length of illness, as well as the number of symptoms and complications. 

If we can gather enough data from people we can create charts that hopefully should be able to create a picture of what remedies are most useful. At the very least, we can use this chart to share information on herbal treatments people are using. 

There are two pages to this chart, on the second page I've created an example of how to fill out the data. If anyone needs to add columns they can do so. Data can be entered for each person experiencing illness. So if you treat three different people you can update the data on each of their treatments separately.

Elderberry Inhibits Coronavirus In-Vitro,"Elderberry (Sambucus Nigra) has been shown to inhibit Coronavirus in-vitro at an early point in infection. This may seem too good to be true but bear with me and read the studies.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899428/

""These results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can inhibit IBV at an early point in infection and suggest that it does so by compromising virion structure. Overall these studies identified a plant extract with previously unknown effects against IBV, which could potentially lead to effective treatments or prevention of this or similar coronaviruses.

Treatment with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by four orders of magnitude at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in a dose-responsive manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by six orders of magnitude and pretreatment of virus was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition.

These results have the potential to translate into treatments for other coronaviruses, including those that affect humans.""

IBV(Infectous Bronchitis Virus) is a poultry coronavirus with high genetic similarity to Covid 19 and uses the same mechanism for infection. Israeli scientists are currently using the IBV vaccine to try to make a vaccine for Coivid 19

""IBV is a disease affecting poultry, and the new vaccine was found to be effective in pre-clinical trials at the Volcani Institute. The researchers discovered a potential Covid-19 vaccine candidate as a by-product of the IBV vaccine.

According to research findings, the poultry coronavirus possesses high genetic similarity to Covid-19 and uses the same mechanism for infection"".

Elderberry is also one of the only supplements which has been shown to significantly shorten influenza  duration in humans by at least 66% (2 days instead of 6 on average). It has broad antiviral properties.

Treating Coronavirus with Stephen Harrod Buhner,"[This is a section of his book Herbal Antivirals](https://pastebin.com/j6ULFp1b), which is \*packed\* full of the molecular biology of emerging infections (SARS, for example), but also humor and useful home recipes for tinctures &amp; teas.  


This section concerns treating the original SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), but let's assume that there's enough crossover that these herbs will certainly be useful in treating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).  


1. Stephen Harrod Buhner - Herbal Antivirals\_ Natural Remedies for Emerging &amp; Resistant Viral Infections-Storey Publishing, LLC (2013)
2. SARS and Coronaviruses
3. SARS is, in its impacts in the body, very similar to acute influenza
4. and at first was thought to be an emerging influenzal strain. However,
5. SARS (sudden acute respiratory syndrome) is a new, emerging viral
6. pathogen that appeared suddenly in 2002 in China. The disease is
7. characterized by fever followed by respiratory symptoms and, ultimately
8. for some of those infected, progressive respiratory failure. The
9. nature of the virus, at the time, was unknown but eventually it was
10. found to be a coronavirus that had jumped species. Into us.
11. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. They
12. possess the largest genome of all the RNA viruses. The viruses in this
13. group engage in a very high frequency of RNA combinations, continually
14. producing new variants. Of the dozen or so coronaviruses only
15. three infect people. Among them, SARS is the most serious.
16. The virus takes about 6 days to develop in the body and, like
17. influenza, is primarily spread by respiratory droplets — though direct
18. contact with body secretions can also transmit it. The virus sheds particles
19. in feces and urine, often for several weeks, and cleaning up after
20. the severely ill can spread the infection. Fever, cough, and difficulty
21. breathing are the first symptoms of the disease. Headache, muscular
22. stiffness, myalgia, loss of appetite, malaise, chills, confusion, dizziness,
23. rash, night sweats, nausea, and diarrhea occur for many.
24. With increasing age comes increasing fatality. Those under the
25. age of 24 are not very susceptible. For those aged 25 to 44 the fatality
26. rate is 6 percent. It is 15 percent in those 45 to 64 and greater than 50
27. percent in those over 65.
28. SARS, unlike influenza, attaches not to sialic acid linkages but to
29. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). This is an integral membrane
30. protein on many cells throughout the body, including the heart,
31. vascular cells, and kidneys. It is intimately involved in regulating the
32. renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is intimately involved in
33. vascular constriction and renal electrolyte homeodynamis, which is
34. where its primary impacts were thought to be. But the RAS is also crucial
35. to the functioning of most organs, including the lungs, spleen, and
36. lymph nodes. ACE-2 converts angiotensin II to less potent molecular
37. forms. Among other things angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor
38. but it also is highly bioactive along a range of cellular actions.
39. SARS viruses attach to ACE-2 on the surface of lung, lymph, and
40. spleen epithelial cells.
41. (Licorice, Chinese skullcap, luteolin, horse
42. chestnut, Polygonum spp., Rheum officinale, and plants high in procyanidins
43. and lectins such as elder and cinnamon block attachment
44. to varying degrees.)
45. Once the receptors on these cells are compromised
46. there is enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema,
47. neutrophil accumulation, and worsened lung function. In essence,
48. once the virus begins attaching to ACE-2, ACE-2 function begins to
49. be destroyed. ACE-2 function also tends to be less dynamic as people
50. grow older, hence the more negative the effects of SARS infection
51. on the elderly.
52. (Kudzu, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and ginkgo all upregulate
53. and protect ACE-2 expression and activity and lower angiotensin II
54. levels.)
55. ACE (in contrast to ACE-2) inhibitors increase the presence of
56. ACE-2 and help protect the lungs from injury. (Hawthorn and kudzu,
57. for example.)
58. Upon infection by the SARS virus, similarly to influenza, inflammatory
59. cytokines are strongly upregulated. IFN-γ, CXCL10, IL-1ß,
60. TNF-α, and IL-6 are primary, IL-6 particularly so. RANTES, MCP-1,
61. and IL-8 are elevated in about half of those who are infected. The p38
62. MAPK pathway is highly stimulated and as the infection progresses
63. levels of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) and TGF-ß both rise (with a later
64. elevation of IL-2). Lowering TGF levels is very helpful (Angelica
65. sinensis, Astragalus mongholicus). HMGB1 levels during SARS cytokine
66. cascades are high, especially in those who die. During the infection,
67. the cytokine cascade initiates a massive immune cell migration,
68. infiltration, and accumulation into lung tissues. The older the infected
69. animal (human or otherwise), the greater the cytokine upregulation
70. and the worse the outcome. Sharply reducing IL-1ß has been found
71. to significantly decrease the impact of the disease on the infected
72. and to inhibit mortality (Japanese knotweed — i.e., Polygonum cuspidatum
73. — Chinese senega root, Chinese skullcap, cordyceps, kudzu,
74. and boneset).
75. Severe hypoxia occurs in the cells that are affected
76. (and in the person so afflicted). The RAS-stimulated cellular hypoxia
77. generates high levels of free radicals through the rapid increase of
78. angiotensin II, i.e., a hypoxia-reoxygenation injury cycle. In essence
79. an abundance of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals is generated.
80. The high levels of angiotensin II stimulate free radical formation
81. from endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and mesangial
82. cells as well. In short the excessive angiotensin II levels (due to the
83. destruction of ACE-2 cells by the virus) cause massive damage to the
84. lung, lymph, and spleen tissue. Protecting the cells from the induced
85. hypoxia significantly reduces the damage in the lungs. (Rhodiola
86. is specific for this. It prevents hypoxia-induced oxidative damage,
87. increases intracellular oxygen diffusion, and increases the efficiency
88. of oxygen utilization.)
89. The virus specifically targets (and replicates within) ciliated cells,
90. destroying the cells and their capacity to move mucus up and out of
91. the lungs. (Cilia-protective herbs are cordyceps, olive oil and leaf, the
92. berberine plants, and Bidens pilosa.) Autoantibodies are produced that
93. begin to attack host epithelial and endothelial cells, increasing the
94. destruction. Reducing the autoimmune response (rhodiola, astragalus,
95. cordyceps) and protecting endothelial cells (Japanese knotweed) is
96. crucial.
97. Autopsies of those who died revealed that the alveolar damage in
98. the lungs was severe. There was massive damage to the lymph nodes
99. in the lungs, as well as severe necrosis in the white pulp and marginal
100. sinus of the spleen, destruction of the germinal centers in the lymph,
101. apoptosis of lymphocytes, and an infiltration of monocytic cells.
102. Protection of the spleen and lymph is essential (red root, poke root,
103. Chinese skullcap).
104. SARS replicates primarily in ciliated epithelial cells but also in
105. infected dendritic cells, both mature and immature. Dendritic cells
106. exist abundantly just under the epithelium layers in the lung tissue.
107. The cytokine upregulation makes the endothelium much more porous,
108. allowing the virus to penetrate and infect the dendritic cells. It does
109. not kill the dendritic cells but merely stops them from stimulating
110. an effective adaptive immune response. The virus very powerfully
111. upregulates IL-6 and IL-8 in the epithelial cells. These particular cytokines
112. concentrate around the immature dendritic cells and strongly
113. inhibit their maturation.. This in turn inhibits mature dendritic cells’
114. ability to prime the production of active T cells and allows the virus to
115. enter and severely damage the lymph organs in the lungs. Stimulating
116. dendritic cell maturation (cordyceps) and increasing T cell counts
117. (licorice, red root, elder, and zinc) will reduce the symptom picture
118. and disease severity.
119. Medical Treatment
120. Ribavirin is only marginally effective against SARS but is still used
121. in spite of the side effects. Corticosteroids are used to try and reduce
122. inflammation. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin
123. has shown potent antiviral activity against the virus and should
124. be used. Rimantidine and lopinavir have both been found active
125. in vitro.
126. The SARS Protocol
127. The plants found specific for the SARS virus are Chinese skullcap,
128. houttuynia, isatis, licorice, Forsythia suspensa, and Sophora flavescens.
129. I would use the exact same protocol as for influenza, outlined earlier,
130. with two exceptions:
131. • Because Salvia miltiorrhiza is so specific for the virus and due
132. to the fact that HMGB1 is usually present, I would use one of the
133. HMGB1 formulations (see page 52) from the day the infection
134. begins.
135. • Because kudzu is so specific for this virus, I would add kudzu to the
136. HMGB1 formulation. For the tincture formulation, add an equal
137. part of kudzu tincture and increase the dosage by one-third; for
138. the aqueous infusion, add an equal amount of the dried root to the
139. formulation.
140. Other Anti-SARS Herbs
141. Other plants found active against SARS are:
142. Artemisia annua
143. Cassia tora
144. Cibotium barometz
145. Dioscorea batatas
146. Eucalyptus spp.
147. Gentiana scabra
148. Lindera aggregata
149. Lonicera japonica
150. Lycoris radiata (stem extracts are
151. extremely potent)
152. Panax ginseng
153. Polygonum cuspidatum
154. Polygonum multiflorum
155. Pyrrosia lingua
156. Rheum officinale
157. Taxillus chinensis",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/fg6vw9/treating_coronavirus_with_stephen_harrod_buhner/,herbalism,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,

Natural approaches to prevent or ease coronavirus symptoms,"I've decided to write this post to try to be of some help to whoever may need to protect himself from this new virus or to ease it if you've already caught it and you cannot afford conventional healthcare, or you want to complement it (or you just aren't covered by any insurance).  Nothing here might be considered to be a cure, but, even so, there's science behind it and studies, some of them just published a few days ago, and some others were investigated in the past SARS and MERS outbreaks and can be applicable now because of similarities between them.

In cases like this, it's usual to re-investigate some drugs that have been proven successful in treating similar viruses and reutilize them for the newly discovered one, because they often share common targets that can be addressed. If this process fails to find a good candidate, a research is done using previously known substances, that can be thousands, both natural and man-made, to look for the more promising ones and, then, try them, first in vitro and later in animals and humans.

The trial with some old pharmaceutical antivirals hasn't been particularly exciting, the flu ones have failed to work (like Oseltamivir), but some designed for an Ebola trial and for the first SARS seem to work well, like Remdesivir. The problem is that they either aren't yet available or that they'll be prohibitively expensive in some countries.

The good news is that some natural (or natural derived) ones have been especially effective, with **Chloroquine** being the big winner of the round. Chloroquine is derived from the Cinchona tree, and has been used to treat malaria, autoimmune conditions... It's very difficult to compare the usefulness of two drugs being so early, but, at this time, it's at the same level as antivirals and it has been tried in at least 280 persons, obtaining very good results.

One key matter regarding this substance is that it seems that the new Covid-19 kills many people by something called Cytokine Storm, that's basically an hyper-reaction of the immune system that makes you collapse in a similar way that an anaphylactic reaction does. This is where the Cholorquine comes in, changing the way that some cellular organelles, called lysosomes, work, keeping them from doing such widespread damage. Apart from it, the substance has good antiviral effects on its own.

**Beware that Chloroquine is a powerful substance with many contraindications and interactions, some of them can be fatal**, so, even if its origin is natural (quinine, that's present in tonic water), it isn't safe, and you shouldn't consider taking it without medical advice. I mention it just to show a natural derived compound that seems as effective as modern antivirals (for this particular case) but don't think about it at the same level as the other plants I speak about.

Additionally,  an investigation has been done comparing tridimensional structures of some of the viral targets, in a theoretical way at first, and  a few natural candidates have been found for further testing, some of them have behind an ancient usage by traditional medicines that support their possible utility.

(see  [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383520302999?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383520302999?via%3Dihub) )

I'm going to mention just some of them:

* One of them is **Andrographis** and its active principles, called Andrographolides. It has been used to treat pneumonia, tonsillitis, colds, parasites, autoimmune conditions, ulcerative colitis... from ancient times.

I can personally attest that it works very well in airway viral infections, even in moderately serious ones, especially if you take it before 48h after starting with symptoms. It has immune-modulating, antibacterial and antiviral properties.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Silybin**, derived from Milk Thistle, is a hepatoprotective substance that has been proved useful for treating cancer, drug toxicity, hepatic viral infections...
* **Hesperidin**. It is a flavonoid extracted from citrus plants. It has been found to interact with the ACE2 receptor in the lungs, which the virus needs to access human cells, staying ""in the middle"" and preventing it from entering inside. It's normally used to help with circulatory problems.
* **Scutellaria** plant (skullcap), and one of its component called Baicalin. This is another one that I've seen ""in action"" and it's very effective as an anti-inflammatory.
* **Rosemarinic** acid, from Rosemary and Salvia Miltiorrhiza.
* **Polygonum Cuspidatum**. This is a usual source of Resveratrol, a very known antioxidant and antiaging substance. But I'm not sure if this is the active component in Polygonum, it may be its anthraquinones the ones responsible for this benefit.
* **Glycyrrhizin**, found in large quantities in Licorice. This one is very effective as an antiviral and it also inhibits HMGB1, which keeps the immune system from overreacting.
* **Saikosaponin A**, found in the Bupleurum plant, that is used, as an example, for hepatic problems, including viral infections.

Personally, I'd also look at some other compounds, because of their renowned effects in chronic and acute viral illnesses:

* **Isatis Indigotica** ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115693](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115693) )
* **Thymoquinone**, from Black Cumin (Nigella Sativa) ( [https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/5/1355](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/5/1355) ,  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933739/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933739/) )
* **Coriolus Versicolor** is a mushroom used to treat viral infections and cancer. It has one of the most studied natural molecules, called PSK or Polysaccharide K.
* **Cordyceps**. It is a fungus that has a compound called Cordycepin, an analogue of Adenosine, that interferes with viral replication.

If I think about the most simple approach just to aim for some general prevention purpose, **Zinc** is widely accepted to help to fight viral infections and a herb called **Astragalus** is quite good at improving both adaptive and innate immune responses. **Vitamin A** is often underestimated but works really well at preventing recurrent upper airway infections.

Take into consideration that, as I have explained before, there's a risk that this illness could cause a massive immune response that can cause a total collapse of the body's capability of maintaining its own homeostasis that can lead to fatal consequences, so, taking some immune-stimulating herbs **while you are already sick** may, in theory, worsen your condition. Much has been written about this possible effect and the results of the tests, don't usually show this theoretical effect in practical cases. Even so, traditional medicines like TCM, advise against taking some of them, like Astragalus, while on acute illness, this is why I've skipped some of them that have strong immune-boosting capabilities when I speak about treating an actual disease.

Chloroquine to fight covid-19: 1 death in 1003 patients.,"I sent a previous post about plants to help for Covid-19. Now it relates chloroquine if you are interested:

It's been sent 1 hour ago. Didier Raoult released his latest in vivo covid-19 treatment. His team treated 1003 patients in IHU Marseille with hydroxychloroquine-azithromycine . Only 1 death. We waited bigger sample evidence, we know have the confirmation that giving that as soon as people get covid-19 positive reduces mortality rate.

Note that there were 1 chinese study showing no big impact compared to a control group (30 people sample) (forbes sended it but that was without azithromycine) and also one previous 80 patients study by Didier Raoult that was less convincing than the numbers he gives now. What the latest 1003 stat shows without doubt is that giving that chloroquine protocol as early as covid tested and assuming we have this strategy in place and we don't wait for the covid-19 to evolve into pneumonia/lung infection/death, then it's confirmed that it reduces mortality rate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/fr6qwn/chloroquine_to_fight_covid19_1_death_in_1003/,herbalism,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,

I think my wormwood supplement just cured my symptoms that line up with covid-19,"I began taking wormwood supplements just when I started to feel symptoms that I’ve never ever had before. My acupuncturist who specializes in CCM recommended it to me because of a parasite. Now I don’t know if there was actually a parasite in my body because I did not go to a doctor but I had some gnarly stomach issues, headaches, major fatigue, sore throat, tightness in my chest, and nightly chills. These are many common symptoms of covid-19. 
Currently the county I live in and in many parts of California are lacking test kits for the virus. In fact before lockdowns were in place I was self -quarantining days before. I definitely was in a bad place... until I started taking wormwood. I’ve taking it ten days in a row, and I already have energy to lightly run again, and do short bouts of exercise. Before, I was struggling to walk to the mailbox. 

I definitely thought it was a combination of the supplements the acupuncturist put me on UNTIL I discovered an interesting piece of research about wormwood...

“Artemisinin is a globally recognized remedy for malaria derived from sweet wormwood, a plant used in TCM. Tu Youyou, the Chinese scientist who turned to ancient Chinese medical texts to find artemisinin, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2015.”

Many research breakthroughs are currently being discovered about how antimalaria medications are helping cure COVID-19. A common ingredient in these medications is artemisinin which I discovered is from wormwood.

Im wondering if that’s the key piece to the puzzle, and my acupuncturist unknowingly gave it to me because I muscle tested that I needed it.

Elderberry Inhibits Coronavirus In-Vitro,"Elderberry (Sambucus Nigra) has been shown to inhibit Coronavirus in-vitro at an early point in infection. This may seem too good to be true but bear with me and read the studies.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3899428/

""These results demonstrate that S. nigra extract can inhibit IBV at an early point in infection and suggest that it does so by compromising virion structure. Overall these studies identified a plant extract with previously unknown effects against IBV, which could potentially lead to effective treatments or prevention of this or similar coronaviruses.

Treatment with S. nigra extracts reduced virus titers by four orders of magnitude at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in a dose-responsive manner. Infection at a low MOI reduced viral titers by six orders of magnitude and pretreatment of virus was necessary, but not sufficient, for full virus inhibition.

These results have the potential to translate into treatments for other coronaviruses, including those that affect humans.""

IBV(Infectous Bronchitis Virus) is a poultry coronavirus with high genetic similarity to Covid 19 and uses the same mechanism for infection. Israeli scientists are currently using the IBV vaccine to try to make a vaccine for Coivid 19

https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/israel-migal-covid-19-vaccine/

""IBV is a disease affecting poultry, and the new vaccine was found to be effective in pre-clinical trials at the Volcani Institute. The researchers discovered a potential Covid-19 vaccine candidate as a by-product of the IBV vaccine.

According to research findings, the poultry coronavirus possesses high genetic similarity to Covid-19 and uses the same mechanism for infection"".

Elderberry is also one of the only supplements which has been shown to significantly shorten influenza  duration in humans by at least 66% (2 days instead of 6 on average). It has broad antiviral properties.

Elderberries and Tamiflu,"I've started writing a blog due to my general frustration at not finding claims in herbalism that are presented with evidence or clinical data. I understand there are a mix of reasons why, but I like the idea of having it together. While I was researching, I came across shikimic acid, one of the constituents of the elderberries (*Sambucus nigra*) I was using for syrup. It turns out that's the ingredient Tamiflu (*Oseltamivir phosphate*), is extracted from, though the manufacturer got it from star anise. It was used to treat the swine flu epidemic a decade or so back.

I looked into it further while the immune system isn't boosted by shikimic acid alone, the quercetin in the berries works with it to kick things up a notch. Might explain why so many of us use it in cold/flu season.

I'm using homemade elderberry syrup at the moment while trying to work out if the 'cytokine storm' risk from coronavirus is a risk factor with the cytokine boost from elderberry, but I have no solid evidence either way yet.

I'm a fan of finding out what the chemical building blocks are of what we do, so I thought a few people might like to know.

TL;DR - elderberries contain the primary chemical Tamiflu, the flu drug, is made from. Interesting, huh?",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/fh6jab/elderberries_and_tamiflu/,herbalism,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,
Treating Coronavirus with Stephen Harrod Buhner,"[This is a section of his book Herbal Antivirals](https://pastebin.com/j6ULFp1b), which is \*packed\* full of the molecular biology of emerging infections (SARS, for example), but also humor and useful home recipes for tinctures &amp; teas.  


This section concerns treating the original SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), but let's assume that there's enough crossover that these herbs will certainly be useful in treating COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2).  


1. Stephen Harrod Buhner - Herbal Antivirals\_ Natural Remedies for Emerging &amp; Resistant Viral Infections-Storey Publishing, LLC (2013)
2. SARS and Coronaviruses
3. SARS is, in its impacts in the body, very similar to acute influenza
4. and at first was thought to be an emerging influenzal strain. However,
5. SARS (sudden acute respiratory syndrome) is a new, emerging viral
6. pathogen that appeared suddenly in 2002 in China. The disease is
7. characterized by fever followed by respiratory symptoms and, ultimately
8. for some of those infected, progressive respiratory failure. The
9. nature of the virus, at the time, was unknown but eventually it was
10. found to be a coronavirus that had jumped species. Into us.
11. Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. They
12. possess the largest genome of all the RNA viruses. The viruses in this
13. group engage in a very high frequency of RNA combinations, continually
14. producing new variants. Of the dozen or so coronaviruses only
15. three infect people. Among them, SARS is the most serious.
16. The virus takes about 6 days to develop in the body and, like
17. influenza, is primarily spread by respiratory droplets — though direct
18. contact with body secretions can also transmit it. The virus sheds particles
19. in feces and urine, often for several weeks, and cleaning up after
20. the severely ill can spread the infection. Fever, cough, and difficulty
21. breathing are the first symptoms of the disease. Headache, muscular
22. stiffness, myalgia, loss of appetite, malaise, chills, confusion, dizziness,
23. rash, night sweats, nausea, and diarrhea occur for many.
24. With increasing age comes increasing fatality. Those under the
25. age of 24 are not very susceptible. For those aged 25 to 44 the fatality
26. rate is 6 percent. It is 15 percent in those 45 to 64 and greater than 50
27. percent in those over 65.
28. SARS, unlike influenza, attaches not to sialic acid linkages but to
29. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). This is an integral membrane
30. protein on many cells throughout the body, including the heart,
31. vascular cells, and kidneys. It is intimately involved in regulating the
32. renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is intimately involved in
33. vascular constriction and renal electrolyte homeodynamis, which is
34. where its primary impacts were thought to be. But the RAS is also crucial
35. to the functioning of most organs, including the lungs, spleen, and
36. lymph nodes. ACE-2 converts angiotensin II to less potent molecular
37. forms. Among other things angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor
38. but it also is highly bioactive along a range of cellular actions.
39. SARS viruses attach to ACE-2 on the surface of lung, lymph, and
40. spleen epithelial cells.
41. (Licorice, Chinese skullcap, luteolin, horse
42. chestnut, Polygonum spp., Rheum officinale, and plants high in procyanidins
43. and lectins such as elder and cinnamon block attachment
44. to varying degrees.)
45. Once the receptors on these cells are compromised
46. there is enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema,
47. neutrophil accumulation, and worsened lung function. In essence,
48. once the virus begins attaching to ACE-2, ACE-2 function begins to
49. be destroyed. ACE-2 function also tends to be less dynamic as people
50. grow older, hence the more negative the effects of SARS infection
51. on the elderly.
52. (Kudzu, Salvia miltiorrhiza, and ginkgo all upregulate
53. and protect ACE-2 expression and activity and lower angiotensin II
54. levels.)
55. ACE (in contrast to ACE-2) inhibitors increase the presence of
56. ACE-2 and help protect the lungs from injury. (Hawthorn and kudzu,
57. for example.)
58. Upon infection by the SARS virus, similarly to influenza, inflammatory
59. cytokines are strongly upregulated. IFN-γ, CXCL10, IL-1ß,
60. TNF-α, and IL-6 are primary, IL-6 particularly so. RANTES, MCP-1,
61. and IL-8 are elevated in about half of those who are infected. The p38
62. MAPK pathway is highly stimulated and as the infection progresses
63. levels of PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) and TGF-ß both rise (with a later
64. elevation of IL-2). Lowering TGF levels is very helpful (Angelica
65. sinensis, Astragalus mongholicus). HMGB1 levels during SARS cytokine
66. cascades are high, especially in those who die. During the infection,
67. the cytokine cascade initiates a massive immune cell migration,
68. infiltration, and accumulation into lung tissues. The older the infected
69. animal (human or otherwise), the greater the cytokine upregulation
70. and the worse the outcome. Sharply reducing IL-1ß has been found
71. to significantly decrease the impact of the disease on the infected
72. and to inhibit mortality (Japanese knotweed — i.e., Polygonum cuspidatum
73. — Chinese senega root, Chinese skullcap, cordyceps, kudzu,
74. and boneset).
75. Severe hypoxia occurs in the cells that are affected
76. (and in the person so afflicted). The RAS-stimulated cellular hypoxia
77. generates high levels of free radicals through the rapid increase of
78. angiotensin II, i.e., a hypoxia-reoxygenation injury cycle. In essence
79. an abundance of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals is generated.
80. The high levels of angiotensin II stimulate free radical formation
81. from endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, and mesangial
82. cells as well. In short the excessive angiotensin II levels (due to the
83. destruction of ACE-2 cells by the virus) cause massive damage to the
84. lung, lymph, and spleen tissue. Protecting the cells from the induced
85. hypoxia significantly reduces the damage in the lungs. (Rhodiola
86. is specific for this. It prevents hypoxia-induced oxidative damage,
87. increases intracellular oxygen diffusion, and increases the efficiency
88. of oxygen utilization.)
89. The virus specifically targets (and replicates within) ciliated cells,
90. destroying the cells and their capacity to move mucus up and out of
91. the lungs. (Cilia-protective herbs are cordyceps, olive oil and leaf, the
92. berberine plants, and Bidens pilosa.) Autoantibodies are produced that
93. begin to attack host epithelial and endothelial cells, increasing the
94. destruction. Reducing the autoimmune response (rhodiola, astragalus,
95. cordyceps) and protecting endothelial cells (Japanese knotweed) is
96. crucial.
97. Autopsies of those who died revealed that the alveolar damage in
98. the lungs was severe. There was massive damage to the lymph nodes
99. in the lungs, as well as severe necrosis in the white pulp and marginal
100. sinus of the spleen, destruction of the germinal centers in the lymph,
101. apoptosis of lymphocytes, and an infiltration of monocytic cells.
102. Protection of the spleen and lymph is essential (red root, poke root,
103. Chinese skullcap).
104. SARS replicates primarily in ciliated epithelial cells but also in
105. infected dendritic cells, both mature and immature. Dendritic cells
106. exist abundantly just under the epithelium layers in the lung tissue.
107. The cytokine upregulation makes the endothelium much more porous,
108. allowing the virus to penetrate and infect the dendritic cells. It does
109. not kill the dendritic cells but merely stops them from stimulating
110. an effective adaptive immune response. The virus very powerfully
111. upregulates IL-6 and IL-8 in the epithelial cells. These particular cytokines
112. concentrate around the immature dendritic cells and strongly
113. inhibit their maturation.. This in turn inhibits mature dendritic cells’
114. ability to prime the production of active T cells and allows the virus to
115. enter and severely damage the lymph organs in the lungs. Stimulating
116. dendritic cell maturation (cordyceps) and increasing T cell counts
117. (licorice, red root, elder, and zinc) will reduce the symptom picture
118. and disease severity.
119. Medical Treatment
120. Ribavirin is only marginally effective against SARS but is still used
121. in spite of the side effects. Corticosteroids are used to try and reduce
122. inflammation. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin
123. has shown potent antiviral activity against the virus and should
124. be used. Rimantidine and lopinavir have both been found active
125. in vitro.
126. The SARS Protocol
127. The plants found specific for the SARS virus are Chinese skullcap,
128. houttuynia, isatis, licorice, Forsythia suspensa, and Sophora flavescens.
129. I would use the exact same protocol as for influenza, outlined earlier,
130. with two exceptions:
131. • Because Salvia miltiorrhiza is so specific for the virus and due
132. to the fact that HMGB1 is usually present, I would use one of the
133. HMGB1 formulations (see page 52) from the day the infection
134. begins.
135. • Because kudzu is so specific for this virus, I would add kudzu to the
136. HMGB1 formulation. For the tincture formulation, add an equal
137. part of kudzu tincture and increase the dosage by one-third; for
138. the aqueous infusion, add an equal amount of the dried root to the
139. formulation.
140. Other Anti-SARS Herbs
141. Other plants found active against SARS are:
142. Artemisia annua
143. Cassia tora
144. Cibotium barometz
145. Dioscorea batatas
146. Eucalyptus spp.
147. Gentiana scabra
148. Lindera aggregata
149. Lonicera japonica
150. Lycoris radiata (stem extracts are
151. extremely potent)
152. Panax ginseng
153. Polygonum cuspidatum
154. Polygonum multiflorum
155. Pyrrosia lingua
156. Rheum officinale
157. Taxillus chinensis",https://www.reddit.com/r/herbalism/comments/fg6vw9/treating_coronavirus_with_stephen_harrod_buhner/,herbalism,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
Natural approaches to prevent or ease coronavirus symptoms,"I've decided to write this post to try to be of some help to whoever may need to protect himself from this new virus or to ease it if you've already caught it and you cannot afford conventional healthcare, or you want to complement it (or you just aren't covered by any insurance).  Nothing here might be considered to be a cure, but, even so, there's science behind it and studies, some of them just published a few days ago, and some others were investigated in the past SARS and MERS outbreaks and can be applicable now because of similarities between them.

In cases like this, it's usual to re-investigate some drugs that have been proven successful in treating similar viruses and reutilize them for the newly discovered one, because they often share common targets that can be addressed. If this process fails to find a good candidate, a research is done using previously known substances, that can be thousands, both natural and man-made, to look for the more promising ones and, then, try them, first in vitro and later in animals and humans.

The trial with some old pharmaceutical antivirals hasn't been particularly exciting, the flu ones have failed to work (like Oseltamivir), but some designed for an Ebola trial and for the first SARS seem to work well, like Remdesivir. The problem is that they either aren't yet available or that they'll be prohibitively expensive in some countries.

The good news is that some natural (or natural derived) ones have been especially effective, with **Chloroquine** being the big winner of the round. Chloroquine is derived from the Cinchona tree, and has been used to treat malaria, autoimmune conditions... It's very difficult to compare the usefulness of two drugs being so early, but, at this time, it's at the same level as antivirals and it has been tried in at least 280 persons, obtaining very good results.

One key matter regarding this substance is that it seems that the new Covid-19 kills many people by something called Cytokine Storm, that's basically an hyper-reaction of the immune system that makes you collapse in a similar way that an anaphylactic reaction does. This is where the Cholorquine comes in, changing the way that some cellular organelles, called lysosomes, work, keeping them from doing such widespread damage. Apart from it, the substance has good antiviral effects on its own.

**Beware that Chloroquine is a powerful substance with many contraindications and interactions, some of them can be fatal**, so, even if its origin is natural (quinine, that's present in tonic water), it isn't safe, and you shouldn't consider taking it without medical advice. I mention it just to show a natural derived compound that seems as effective as modern antivirals (for this particular case) but don't think about it at the same level as the other plants I speak about.

Additionally,  an investigation has been done comparing tridimensional structures of some of the viral targets, in a theoretical way at first, and  a few natural candidates have been found for further testing, some of them have behind an ancient usage by traditional medicines that support their possible utility.

(see  [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383520302999?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383520302999?via%3Dihub) )

I'm going to mention just some of them:

* One of them is **Andrographis** and its active principles, called Andrographolides. It has been used to treat pneumonia, tonsillitis, colds, parasites, autoimmune conditions, ulcerative colitis... from ancient times.

I can personally attest that it works very well in airway viral infections, even in moderately serious ones, especially if you take it before 48h after starting with symptoms. It has immune-modulating, antibacterial and antiviral properties.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Silybin**, derived from Milk Thistle, is a hepatoprotective substance that has been proved useful for treating cancer, drug toxicity, hepatic viral infections...
* **Hesperidin**. It is a flavonoid extracted from citrus plants. It has been found to interact with the ACE2 receptor in the lungs, which the virus needs to access human cells, staying ""in the middle"" and preventing it from entering inside. It's normally used to help with circulatory problems.
* **Scutellaria** plant (skullcap), and one of its component called Baicalin. This is another one that I've seen ""in action"" and it's very effective as an anti-inflammatory.
* **Rosemarinic** acid, from Rosemary and Salvia Miltiorrhiza.
* **Polygonum Cuspidatum**. This is a usual source of Resveratrol, a very known antioxidant and antiaging substance. But I'm not sure if this is the active component in Polygonum, it may be its anthraquinones the ones responsible for this benefit.
* **Glycyrrhizin**, found in large quantities in Licorice. This one is very effective as an antiviral and it also inhibits HMGB1, which keeps the immune system from overreacting.
* **Saikosaponin A**, found in the Bupleurum plant, that is used, as an example, for hepatic problems, including viral infections.

Personally, I'd also look at some other compounds, because of their renowned effects in chronic and acute viral illnesses:

* **Isatis Indigotica** ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115693](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16115693) )
* **Thymoquinone**, from Black Cumin (Nigella Sativa) ( [https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/5/1355](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/19/5/1355) ,  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933739/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3933739/) )
* **Coriolus Versicolor** is a mushroom used to treat viral infections and cancer. It has one of the most studied natural molecules, called PSK or Polysaccharide K.
* **Cordyceps**. It is a fungus that has a compound called Cordycepin, an analogue of Adenosine, that interferes with viral replication.

If I think about the most simple approach just to aim for some general prevention purpose, **Zinc** is widely accepted to help to fight viral infections and a herb called **Astragalus** is quite good at improving both adaptive and innate immune responses. **Vitamin A** is often underestimated but works really well at preventing recurrent upper airway infections.

Take into consideration that, as I have explained before, there's a risk that this illness could cause a massive immune response that can cause a total collapse of the body's capability of maintaining its own homeostasis that can lead to fatal consequences, so, taking some immune-stimulating herbs **while you are already sick** may, in theory, worsen your condition. Much has been written about this possible effect and the results of the tests, don't usually show this theoretical effect in practical cases. Even so, traditional medicines like TCM, advise against taking some of them, like Astragalus, while on acute illness, this is why I've skipped some of them that have strong immune-boosting capabilities when I speak about treating an actual disease.

Elderberry may exacerbate cytokine storms,"The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2/CoViD-19, like the 1918 H1N1 Spanish Flu, kills people in part through cytokine storms, where the immune system attacks one's own body.

However, if one would pick one of these websites that sell this protocol out the litter, for example coronavirusdefense.com, would I be wrong to be skeptical?

The master herbalist of Vivify Holistic Clinic, David Raes, is trained by the School of Natural Healing, which if one were to look at their very late 90’s-designed website, is pretty much a cult with varying levels of questionable knowledge in herbalism costing thousands and thousands of dollars in costs on the different programs and books. Yes, you too can aspire to be a master-herbalist for the low-low price of 5,125 dollars, that is, without correspondence.

If the cost itself doesn’t cover it, read the preview on Amazon of the reference manual of this school of herbalistic thought (https://www.amazon.co.uk/School-Natural-Healing-Reference-Practitioner/dp/1879436019/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_pl_foot_top?ie=UTF8).

Encouraging Report from China on IV VitaminC for COVID-19 Coronavirus,"Successful High-Dose Vitamin C Treatment of Patients with Serious and Critical COVID-19 Infection

*Dr. Mao stated that his group* ***treated \~50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19*** *infection with high dose IVC. The IVC dosing was in the range of 10,000 mg - 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases, determined by pulmonary status (mostly the oxygenation index) and coagulation status.* 

***All patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality****. Compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients.* 

*Dr. Mao discussed one severe case in particular who was deteriorating rapidly. He gave a bolus of 50,000 mg IVC over a period of 4 hours. The patient's pulmonary (oxygenation index) status stabilized and improved as the critical care team watched in real time.* 

*There were no side effects reported from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC.*

Dr Mao is chief of Emergency at a hospital and a med school prof.

Roughly 50% of tropical cruise passengers who tested positive for Covid-19 had little or no symptoms of the virus, a far higher percentage than found in Wuhan, China, much farther North. Might that be due to the vitamin D from sunlight while on a cruise ship in the tropics?    \[Link Available\]

&amp;#x200B;

""The Vitamin D Binding Protein (GcMAF) is a multi-functional plasma protein, made in the liver, with many important functions. The most well known one, and the reason for its name, is the transport of vitamin D metabolites. ...Activating macrophages and actin removal are considered to be other very important roles of VDBP....In order for the VDBP to activate macrophages (thus for the GcMAF to work properly) it needs adequate amounts of vitamin D3 in the blood.""

Colloidal silver and 5G?,"So, everyone is talking about theoretical links between covid 19 and 5G, and everyone is talking about colloidal silver and it's antiviral abilities and potential as a cure. But listening to the 5G theories about aluminum and heavy metals build up in our bodies and turning them into 5G signal antennas, etc. I couldn't help but wonder about colloidal silver use and 5G?

I know many advocates say silver is a noble metal rather than a heavy metal, or that it simply isn't toxic in the way aluminum is etc., or nano-silver is flushed out of the body...

But I've googled, and duck duck go-ed, and tried colloidal silver Facebook groups - no where can I find any information, thoughts or theories relating to colloids and potential interaction with 5G! I mean, both these things/topics are heavily discussed in general by the same kinds of alternative health-minded folk, but they are never addressed together? 

In fact, I could only find people advising colloidal silver use for immune system boosting to combat 5G effects - no mention of how or why colloidal silver would have a positive affect re 5G.

THIS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT!  PLEASE  READ AND COMMENT!
IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT AND UNDER COVER OF THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC THE ADA HAS SANCTIONED A SPECIALTY IN OROFACIAL PAIN.
THE ADA HAS DENIED SPECIALTY FOR OVER 30 YEARS
THIS IS HORRENDOUS NEWS FOR PATIENTS WITH TMJ DISORDERS WHO RESPOND TO OCCLUSAL THERAPY.
THIS IS ALSO A SEVERE BLOW TO DENTIST  WHO TREAT  SLEEP APNEA, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED DIPLOMATE STATUS WITH THE AMERICAN BOARD OF DENTAL SLEEP MEDICINE AND THE AMERICAN BOARD OF SLEEP AND BREATHING.
THESE DENTISTS HAVE FAR MORE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE IN THE TREATMENT OF SLEEP APNEA THAN DO MOST MEMBERS OF THE AAOP.
THE ADA WAS PREVIOUSLY SUED BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF HEAD, NECK AND FACIAL PAIN MANY YEARS AGO FOR GOING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS TO CHANGE CREATE STANDARDS FOR TREATING TMJ DISORDERS WITHOUT COMMENT.
THE ADA WON THE SUIT AND THE COURT SAID THAT THE ADA COULD HOLD A SECRET BEHIND CLOSED DOORS MEETING BUT THEY COULD NOT IMPLEMENT THAT DECISION WITHOUT OPEN DISCUSSIONS.
THE SPIRIT OF THAT COURT BATTLE AND PRECEDENT STILL APPLIES.
THE ACADEMY OF OROFACIAL PAIN AND THE ADA SHOULD NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE COVID-19 EPIDEMIC TO SNEAK IN CHANGES THAT WILL FOREVER ADVERSELY AFFECT HEADACHE, MIGRAINE AND TMD PATIENTS AND THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ADA.
I SUGGEST EVERY TMD PATIENT AND EVERY DENTIST LET THE ADA KNOW THAT OPEN DISCUSSIONS IN PUBLIC SHOULD BE HELD.
I HAVE BEEN TOLD IN THE PAST  BY THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE AAOP  THAT SPECIALTY DESIGNATION  IS ALL ABOUT MONEY AND BEING ABLE TO CHARGE MORE AND RECEIVE MORE FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THAT IT WON'T EFFECT PRACTICE STANDARDS.
***THIS IS A LETTER THAT WAS SENT TO THE ADA OVER SPECIALTY BY ME.****

Catherine Baumann, Director

American Dental Association
211 E. Chicago Avenue
Chicago, IL 60611
baumannca@ada.org
Dear Ms. Cathy Baumann
ADA Committee for the Recognition of Dental Specialties and Certifying Boards
Possible Appeal of Denial of AAOP Specialty / non-certification.
This will supplement the comments I submitted on October 10,2019 in sition to ADA recognition of American Academy of Orofacial Pain (the Academy) for specialty in orofacial pain (OP).  Those comments detailed the Academy’s failure to satisfy any of the six requirements for specialty recognition.
(1)          Not Needed  A specialty in orofacial pain is not needed.  Many general practice dentists (GPs), by education and experience, currently are able to recognize causes of orofacial pain and successfully remediate them through treatment modalities within the scope of their general practice licensure.
(2)          Anti-Competitive             The Academy’s request for recognition is anticompetitive for many reasons and, if granted, will harm the public and GPs, many of whom are ADA members.
(a)          Price Creating the specialty will eliminate the right of currently well qualified GPs to provide care within scope of their experience without obtaining unnecessary specialty approval or supervision by the Academy.  Recognition will in the long run exclude GPs as competitors of Academy members while reducing patient access to appropriate care, and will enable those in the proposed specialty group to set (raise) prices without fear of lower price pressure from GPs.  Neither outcome is in the public interest.
(b)          Prejudicial Exclusion       The Academy avowedly opposes occlusion-based treatment modalities of OP despite their indisputable basis in science and demonstrated efficacy through services of GPs.  Allowing the Academy, as manager of the proposed specialty, to set standards which exclude occlusion-based remediation is one more way of limiting competition and patient access to relief currently provided by GPs.
(c)           Subject/Power grab       The Academy and its members have no demonstrated knowledge and skill          in the treatment of sleep apnea, a field of practice which has enjoyed strong growth in recent years.  There are, for example, over 1,000 members in the American Association of Dental Sleep Medicine.  Yet the Academy seeks to sweep into its jurisdiction such treatment, in this way carving out one more way to provide price protection to those within the desired specialty designation.
(d)          Coerced Educational Fees            Add to this the fees the Academy can generate by being the required source of (unneeded) educational training for specialty qualification.  Many GPs already have the necessary skill by virtue of their existing education and practice experience.
(e)          Lack of Grandfather Status          Notably, the Academy does not proposed to confer grandfathered status to those GPs who are already fully qualified by training and practice to relief OP in appropriate cases.
Each of these anticompetitive designs and effects will undoubtedly draw the attention of federal and state anti-trust enforcement bodies.  More litigation is the last thing ADA should wish.
(3)          Discriminatory Membership Practices                    The Academy is a closed group.  It operates on an invitation only basis.  It reserves the right to discriminate unreasonably and unfairly.  I, an advocate of occlusion-based treatment of OP, explored requesting an invitation and was assured none would be forthcoming.  This closed door policy is designed to further restrict membership to those who subscribe to the narrow practice views of the Academy and to exclude me and many other older general practitioners who for years have successfully provided needed relief to patients suffering from OP.
I am requesting the American Civil Liberties Union to approach the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and the Illinois Attorney General to express these concerns.  The practices and their effects promise to harm not only patients, but me and many other general practitioners (including ADA members) who are similarly situated for no countervailing public advantage.
For all these added reasons, the Academy’s proposal should be denied.  If approved, it will deserve government agency intervention and, failing that, class action court scrutiny.

"Wow, fuck NewMind. Just got an email that they have Chloroquine in stock and they specifically mention it's potential use for SARS-CoV-2.","[What a fucking cash grab, for a substance that might be extremely harmful \(e.g., the dude who died and his wife who almost did\).](https://i.imgur.com/5wj4EDm.jpg) 

Image above and here's the text of the email:

&gt; Dear valued NewMind subscriber,
&gt; 
&gt; We hope that you are staying healthy and safe during these difficult times.
&gt; 
&gt; In light of current events, we would like to announce stock of a new product on our website: Chloroquine Phosphate - available both for sale and for donation to qualifying persons.
&gt; 
&gt; Chloroquine is a compound originally discovered through modification of Quinine's structure, and has proven to bear antimalarial, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral effects. It is currently being researched for its potential antiviral effects on HIV and for combating RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
&gt; Chloroquine is currently being deprecated from antimalarial therapy due to the widespread emergence of chloroquine-resistant strains.
&gt; 
&gt; However, it is now increasingly valued for its antiviral and antibacterial benefits, especially in light of its simultaneous effects on immume and inflammatory response, which may synergistically improve benefits in vivo.
&gt; By virtue of its immune modulating effects, Chloroquine is sometimes used for its anti-inflammatory effects, such as to help deal with rheumatoid arthritis. Chloroquine may also be used alongside chemotherapy treatments.
&gt; 
&gt; More recently, Chloroquine has drawn attention for its antiviral properties - and Chloroquine phosphate is currently recommended for use to physicians in China for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.
&gt; Chemical Name        N(4)-(7-Chloro-4-quinolinyl)-N(1),N(1)-diethyl-1,4-pentanediamine, phosphate (1:2)
&gt; CAS Number        50-63-5
&gt; Purity        ≥99%

&amp;#x200B;

ACE-2 is the receptor that binds COVID-19 to cells.

&amp;#x200B;

By Inhibiting ACE-2 Receptors in your body, there is less opportunity for the virus to bind to your cells,and you lessen the chances of the virus spreading throughout your body.

&amp;#x200B;

In conjunction to inhibiting ACE-2 receptors, the next best method in which we can reduce our risk is by strengthening our immune system through the intake of certain supplements and vitamins.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti Viral Agents have been shown to aid in the suppression of the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

I take my research quite vigorously, and I wanted to share this valuable information I've found with y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've compiled a list of supplements and vitamins that will be effective at reducing risk of infection,and increasing survivability from COVID-19.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll update this list as more info is discovered about the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

Research each supplement before taking it.

"ACE inhibitors, ACE2 receptor, Angiotensin and COVID-19. Does having elevated angiotensin levels give resistance to COVID 19 through downregulation of the ACE2 receptor?","It's suspected that taking ACE inhibitors increases the severity of COVID-19 through upregulating the ACE2 receptor but it seems that needing an ACE inhibitor but not taking one would actually give resistance through naturally downregulating the ACE2 receptor through increased Angiotensin II levels.

An ACE inhibitor prevents the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II which causes the ACE2 receptor to upregulate.  But if you don't do that, high levels of angiotensin II downregulates ACE2 receptors so shouldn't this give natural resistance to COVID19 which enters through the ACE2?

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2329828/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2329828/)

"Experience with SAM-e, smoking cessation, and motivation/focus.","I'm on day 4 with taking 400mg SAM-e first thing in the morning on an empty stomach (along with 500mg ascorbyl palmitate.)

Later this morning I could begin to notice what felt like a change in brain chemistry. It persists now into early evening.

The difference is hard to describe, other than to say it is a state of generally positive affect. Also, it seems to be keeping me from the withdrawal symptoms I'd expect to be experiencing.

I've quit nicotine cold turkey in the last 2 days, and it has so far been effortless. I would normally be irritable by now, and continuously faced with the impulse to smoke.

I'm living under the COVID-19 ""stay-at-home"" orders that so many of us are. For me, it means no income. I have savings and available credit to see me through, but I'd rather not put myself in a hole.

I have the opportunity to earn from home, but it requires degrees of focus, motivation, and risk tolerance that are generally unavailable to me.

This represents my primary interest in supplementation. The smoking cessation is secondary.

There is a part of me which actively resists making productive effort that is not routine to me. I'm sure we all experience this, but I am someone who has long defaulted to unhealthy coping mechanisms in the face of that internal resistance.

I'm sure I have labored under that behavioral pattern for long enough that I have balanced my mind toward its reward centers, and away from executive function.

To remedy this, I intend to try phenylpiracetam along side the other 2 supplements I'm using now.

I'll use this as a journey thread to track my progress, as well as a means to learn from others who have experience finding the stack that keeps their focus sharp, and their drive alive.

Would NAC Be Presumably Helpful or Hurtful During Covid-19 Infection?,"*Note:  I know you can't answer this definitively because it's a new virus and all that.  Just asking in case any medical pros are present or anyone can offer studies that would suggest one way or the other.*

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) has expectorant effects to the degree that it's available in prescription form &amp; is used for cystic fibrosis &amp; other lung diseases.  I think it's sold under the name ""Mucomyst"" or similar.  Anyway, would it likely help or hurt during a theoretical infection with the novel COVID-19 virus, which causes dry cough, phlegm (sounds contradictory I know but these are two of the top symptoms) &amp; shortness of breath?  

I take NAC daily to help with liver function &amp; prevent APAP-induced damage.  It definitely makes me cough &amp; feel somewhat short of breath if I take like 1,800mg per day so I try to stick to smaller doses.

can yogurt and kefir cure covid-19 by helping the immune system?,"The actual active ingredient for a drug for acute treatment and prophylactic application, is already known to medical scientists around the world as GAMMA-INTERFERON.

This substance GAMMA-INTERFERON must now only be isolated by the responsible specialists and separated from the corresponding products, which contain this high-quality defence substance against pathogens, in order to then process it into a corresponding medicine, which can be administered to humans.The substance GAMMA-INTERFERON is a natural product of chemical transformation, e.g. when milk is converted to YOGURT or KEFIR. So it is only necessary that the GAMMA-INTERFERON is removed from the mentioned products and converted into a drug.this GAMMA-INTERFERON is practically the same antidote or anti-substance against pathogens as it is produced by the human immune system itself.it also works in the same way as the natural products in terms of antibodies and defences of the human immune system.

The effect is even better if the drug is taken in larger controlled and appropriate amounts. It is able to prevent almost any disease and to nip it in the bud, even cancer of any kind, because when taken and used in appropriate quantities, it is able to destroy even the most persistent viruses, not to mention less resistant pathogens.

Preventative Nootropics That Reduce The Chances Of Infection And Increase Survivability Against COVID-19,"Lately I've been researching preventative measures that reduce the risk of infection and increase survivability against COVID-19.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically I've been researching ACE-2 Receptor Inhibitors,Immune System Boosters,Anti Viral Agents.

&amp;#x200B;

ACE-2 is the receptor that binds COVID-19 to cells.

&amp;#x200B;

By Inhibiting ACE-2 Receptors in your body, there is less opportunity for the virus to bind to your cells,and you lessen the chances of the virus spreading throughout your body.

&amp;#x200B;

In conjunction to inhibiting ACE-2 receptors, the next best method in which we can reduce our risk is by strengthening our immune system through the intake of certain supplements and vitamins.

&amp;#x200B;

Anti Viral Agents have been shown to aid in the suppression of the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

I take my research quite vigorously, and I wanted to share this valuable information I've found with y'all!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I've compiled a list of supplements and vitamins that will be effective at reducing risk of infection,and increasing survivability from COVID-19.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll update this list as more info is discovered about the virus.

&amp;#x200B;

Research each supplement before taking it.

&amp;#x200B;

BCAA (Branched-Chain Amino Acids)

&amp;#x200B;

Bovine Colostrum

&amp;#x200B;

B Vitamins

Preparation for the potential covoid-19. What supplements will you be taking? Most promising one I see is Quercetin.,"Covid-19 AKA coroanvirus has been six confirmed cases in Los Angeles which means this was circulating for weeks. Reason of the low infection rate was due to the lack of testing. If we just view Italy as the prime example of this spreading this will be worse than US, due to the all the travel history of US compared to Italy. 

What supplements are you preparing for a potential infection? The most promising one I seen is Quercetin. It has shown to be affect in vivo and vitro on Ebola, Sars and Zika. Now they are getting ready to try it on Covid-19 in China. Seems very promising, but it has to be done at a high dose, which is not reveled in the articles I seen.

Best nootropics and supplements to strengthen immune system for Corona virus,"Didn't find any info on this subreddit regarding concerns about the coronavirus and possible precautions.

As it is now in almost every part of the world it is possible that some of us will have to deal with it. Even with the often cited 2% average mortality rate any factor lowering this number is worth taking into account.

First of the obvious supplements will be: zinc, vit c, b and d, magnesium and selenium(which i take paranuts for)

I stumbled upon a paper that claims vitamince c will greatly reduce the lethality of people suffering from pneumonia as a result of CoV. (Keep in mind the p value hasnt been adjusted but it is still an interesting study nonetheless )

Furthermore the virus reduces the body's own T cell count. To compensate for this I am planning to start taking Reishi, Lion's mane and cordyceps. Ashtataxin has also been shown to slightly increase t cell count.


On the examine page for Black Cumin Seed there is a claim that the supplement aids in reducing the viral load in patients suffering Hepatitis C. I would be interested in whether this would also translate to CoV. 


At last I stumbled upon a post in a thread of someone claiming that an insanely high dose of 50.000 ui(let me check this) taken once symptoms of the virus occur would activate the immune system to get rid of the virus and it would replenish the livers vitamine a storage(which is depleted during viral infections).

Fermented Wheat germ extract will leave me exposed to viral infections?,"So I've been taking a wheat germ extract supplement for its energy-boosting effects and it has done wonders for me, but since these terrible coronavirus news, I've been checking my supplements and whether or not they can help or hurt in the face of this menace.

First I came across [this study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21892933/) which discusses the potential anti-cancer benefits of FWGE, in the abstract it says: 

&gt;""FWGE modulates immune response by downregulation of MHC-I complex and the induction of TNF-α and various interleukins""

I was vaguely remembered reading something about the human body detecting and fighting the flu through MHC-I expression, and downregulating that could, in fact, be the best possible way to help a virus invade your entire body undetected.I searched and found [this study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01158/full): 

&gt;limiting MHC-I cell surface expression is used by many viruses to evade immune recognition. In particular, downregulation of MHC-I molecules at the cell surface can reduce the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognize viral peptides presented by MHC-I molecules and thereby delay viral clearance by CD8+ T cells. 

Does that mean what I think it does?! If so I'm slightly freaked out because I've been taking FWGE for a long time now, almost a year. Have I inadvertently endangered myself and some other people I introduced to this supplement? That makes me feel even worse! It's one thing to endanger yourself by using lesser-known supplements but I recommended this stuff to a couple of friends and family members who also suffered from low energy levels and some of them ended up taking it long term.

I searched around a bit more and found [this study](https://research.avemar.com/en/antiviral-effects-fermented-wheat-germ-extract-avemar-feline-aids-model) using FWGE on cats with the cat version of the HIV, and it produced very positive effects apparently. So which one is it, is FWGE helpful or harmful for potential viral infections or the body's ability to recognize and fight a viral infection effectively?

On the link there is a detailed explanation about the course. But if you are not convinced by that or just don't want to click, here are some words by me:

I learn and practice with Sifu since 2016. This course is not just an ""emergency trick &amp; tips"", in this course he teach his core teaching: the [5 phase routine](https://flowingzen.com/1068/the-5-phase-routine/). 

You can do this course if you are totally new to QiGong, there is no prerequisite needed. But you get material which allow you to practice QiGong for years.

If you already know QiGong, the 5 phase routine still can be an extension of your practice. It's inclusive, which means you can plug your already known techniques into it and also you don't have to practice this exclusively. So even if you practice QiGong for many years, it can still gives you something new.

Also the course is not just a bunch of videos and texts. You get direct contact with Sifu, if you have any questions he answers them in a few days.

If I understand correctly the course is only free during the crisis. There is no detail exactly what that means at this point, but you can download all videos and audios with a click, so even if it's not free anymore you can save the materials (of course you won't have support anymore).",https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueQiGong/comments/foso9r/covid19_support_learn_qigong_online_from_sifu/,TrueQiGong,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,

Have to share the craziest magnetism experience of my life (4 weeks in),"Hey everyone,

Something unexplainable happened to me today. English isn't my native tongue, this is super long and may not be well written, but I need to type this down. If this inspires a single person, or maybe encourages them to stay on path, my time was well invested.

Alright. I have been on a streak ever since I had a one night stand 4 weeks ago. It has been a very easy streak to be honest, the sex was amazing and I have no desire at all to go back to porn. It just feels deprecating and disgusting to go back to this after the amazing night I shared with this girl. 

So, anyway. Roughly 1 week into my streak (3 weeks ago), I went to a party in our area. I exchanged some looks with a very attractive girl (9/10, very unique facial structure. Looked like a beautiful drawing, in a way. Hard to articulate), and she actually made the move and came up to me (complimented me on my costume, carneval). We talked for a bit and everything was going as smooth as it could. I had peak confidence due to the ONS a week ago, plus minor benefits of 1 week of retaining.

We talk and get along greatly, I can tell that she likes me. A few minutes into the conversation, I ask for her name. We shake hands, and then she tells me that she does have a boyfriend. Alright, what a shame I said, with a smile on my face. It was alright. We talked for a bit and said goodbye. The last time we saw each other she kept looking back in my direction. As I said, she was into me. 


3 weeks pass, until today. I didn't think anything about this anymore. Totally forgot it. Now here is the part that is so crazy, so many coincidences that I just can not explain this with anything other than some sort of higher power or magnetism.

It's around 8pm, and I decide I need to leave the house. I am in Germany and everything is locked down because of Covid-19, we are strongly advised to not meet with people anymore. I got cabin fever and decide to walk to the local supermarket to get some fresh air. Usually I would go by car, but I just decided not to.

As I make my way down, a friend of mine is walking into my direction. We don't shake hands, but we decide to walk to the supermarket together. I have a mask on and keep my distance. We just need to talk because the world is going mad. We are all very concerned here.

We spent around 10 minutes in the market until I have what I need. We head for the check out, and see another friend of us enter the store. We could have been at the liquor shelf, or looking for toilet paper, or whereever. Could have left 5 minutes earlier. But no, we randomly see him entering. We decide to wait in front of the store. He says he doesn't have time, but then he remembers that he has to buy cigarettes for his dad. 

The 3 of us make our way to the next cigarette spot (you don't say cigarette machine, I don't think. You know what I mean). He decides to have a cigarette for himself and we talk for another 5 minutes. Through some random remark of mine, my friend is reminded of the costume I wore 3 weeks ago. And then Friend B, the one that bought the cigarettes, brings up the girl I talked to. You talked to a girl there, didn't you? I say yes, and am already surprised that he remembers me having an overall 10 minute conversation with a random girl multiple weeks ago. I barely even remembered that he was there.

Turns out that this is his former best female friend, and that her boyfriend apparently is going to prison now. I don't know why or what happened, but it sounds like there is trouble there. Maybe she still likes me, this is propably a sign from above that I should ask my friend for her number and say hello again. I am not worried about her boyfriend, I can deal with him. It's just too much of a coincidence to not go after it I think.


Me deciding to go to the store, at this time, to walk there, meet my friend, decide to go there together, spend the right amount of time shopping groceries, be there when our friend walks in, my friend remembering to buy cigarettes, our conversation somehow bringing up this very minor, forgettable event from 3 weeks ago, him being her former best friend and informing me her bf is in trouble, the relationship propably in jeopardy, and me being able to get her number through him. What are the odds? Absolutely insane. I don't even know whats going on anymore. I will definitely text her, already got a good opening line in mind. 


Guys, semen retention is the real deal. I have no idea how to articulate this in a proper way. I mean, other than this event, everything is going much better. I command much more respect, speak with more confidence, am more witty and funny and a better human being overall. I am grateful to have learned about this practice and will continue to retain, you should do the same. That's a rhyme by the way. Good night everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/fmq0ti/have_to_share_the_craziest_magnetism_experience/,Semenretention,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
Day 15 - No Fap- My experiences,"Thank you for posting regularly , brothers . Your posts don’t go unnoticed and they mean a lot to me . 

This is my throwaway account. My real account has a karma of 80k or something . Some details here might leak my identity so I used this one. 

Flatline on day 7 and this morning  , I had morning wood after years !!!

My dick died !!!! Like , unbelievably silent, and absolutely no movement . I was terrified but I knew I had to go through this and also I have NO other option . 

Experiences (not benefits )

1. Received  a call from Hollywood’s top casting director 

2. One really famous director in Hollywood replies to my emails and we talked on Instagram ( a little , just a little less famous than Spielberg) 

3. Crush started talking nicely(after showing contempt)  for no reason 

4. Some guy who took money and abused me wasn’t ready to give the money back . This morning , all of a sudden , he’s like “I’ll pay it back!  I was like “I didn’t even ask this guy  ! Imagine someone paying back money they didn’t have to in this broken economy and these COVID-19 times !

5. My strength in the gym - the gym stops now to look at me . It really does . 

Men are angry at me . The master trainer ignored me and had a look of “who the fuck are you” and now he keeps staring like a fan boy . It’s unreal. 

6. The market is dead . But I make good money on lyft everyday . It’s like it’s totally normal.

7. Finished writing a novel and started another one . 

8. My energy throughout the day is unreal . I can’t believe I wAs throwing away this energy while fapping!! 

9. I come from a small ghetto in India and even talking to big names in Hollywood is a BIG deal. 

10. I’m in control of my thoughts . 

Earlier , no Fap was because of coincidence like “being busy” and “depression” 

Now , it is because of “ I can watch Porn and fap but I have enough self control not to” and that makes such a huge difference. I can do it but I won’t .

Coronavirus inhibited by Zinc,"South Korea and China have had some success treating covid-19 patients with Zinc. Cellular zinc inhibits the virus from replicating. For zinc to get into the cells, it needs help from an ionophore like chloroquine, a common anti malaria drug. 

https://www.peakprosperity.com/forum-topic/chloroquine-use-in-korea-and-china/

This is consistent with what many on this forum have reported about not falling sick as often after starting SR.

Implications: keep doing SR, retain zinc, reduce the odds of getting infected.

Why I believe SR should never become mainstream,"I'm on day 348 of a SR streak, so nearly a year. No wet dreams, only had sex once but I never came. During this time I've had pretty much every benefit you can imagine and it's given me plenty to think about. I'll detail some of the experiences and give you guys my reasoning on why those of us who are aware of this power shouldn't be so quick to share it with others. Unfortunately there are quite a number of, let's just say, misguided people on here so I need to address a few things along the way. 





First, there seems to be quite a number of people on here who seem to believe in a lot of hocus pocus stuff like energy fields, spiritual realms, string theory vibrations, and whole swatches of other nonsense about what it is that they're experiencing. I'm not seeing any of that personally. What's going on with these powers in respect to how others are treating you is almost entirely down to how you smell, your pheromones. There are those that question this because they notice others scoping them out behind glass in cars or in restaurants, but it's important to know that glass is rarely air tight. Your house in the winter still gets air in from the outdoors even with the doors and windows locked tight. Dogs can smell through glass, they can smell through debris when trying to locate bodies under fallen buildings, they can smell drugs through various containers. It's harder than you'd imagine to contain a scent. It is possible to smell something behind a wall. It's also worth noting here that women have a 50% greater sense of smell than men, it's far easier for them to detect these kinds of things than it is for us, so try not to let SR fry your brain and have you believing in nonsense just because you're oblivious to your material world. If people are reaching out to you more and texting you, or calling you more often you've likely left an impression on your surroundings. Going to campus and filling it with your powerful scent is going to generate a buzz in the hive, people will notice and they will talk about you when you're not around. Basically, you'll become popular. Don't be surprised if this popularity leads to unexpected social contacts reaching out to you when ordinarily you'd never hear from them. It's more practical than you think, it's not magic.





Now, on to attraction. Yes women will be attracted to you like crazy if you're doing SR. There are a few things that greatly aid it, like your diet and exercise. Certain things like alcohol and caffeine are terrible for your scent. They're both diuretics, meaning that your body will be trying to filter it out of your system in as many ways as it can. It'll be in your piss, your shit, your breath, your skin, that awful bitter scent will create interference and make you smell terrible even if you can't consciously detect it. The same thing happens with a compromised immune system, people and dogs can tell when someone is sick by the scent of a person with an overactive immune system and will unconsciously keep their distance. What would happen if every man knew about this? If every guy was aware that he could not only attract women like crazy, but could also have a massive leverage over other men socially? Why wouldn't he practice SR? The benefits are so mindblowingly unreal that it would become a mainstream phenomenon. Eventually men would race to maximize their scent and alter their diets. What impact would this have on the economy? I can only imagine the billion dollar industries out there that would become devastated by this sweeping cultural phenomenon. Maybe I'm wrong and your average guy is too lazy to try it but once this becomes verified by mainstream science it'll be hard to be skeptical on SR for long. Coffee, alcohol, fast food, restaurants, snacks, etc. all of these things are bad for you and alter your scent for the worse. These industries stand to lose a lot if this becomes widely known. Bars, nightclubs and restaurants would likely take a massive dive.





One thing I've also seen around the topic of porn and SR is that there's an alarming number of you that seem to believe that porn is a kind of Jewish trick that's meant to deprive European men of their sexual vitality to lower the birth rates in western countries and create a population vacuum that opens the borders to non-white immigrants. No I'm not making this up, there are people out there that really are this retarded. Never mind the fact that porn is accessed in countries all over the world, especially in Japan and India, it's pretty common knowledge that men have been beating off since the dawn of time. Even without porn men on average were spanking it a handful of times a week, it's not natural to hold in semen for long and eventually your desire to get rid of it will arise, or your body will do it for you in your sleep. Trying to keep SR underground isn't some jewish trick here, okay? There are too many idiots out there who have no idea how the world actually works and resort to conspiracy theories about everything that fits their victim culture mentality. One member here in particular thinks ""someone"" paid Tyson Fury to say that he masturbates 7 times a day. There are some seriously sick people on the internet. Fury probably does the opposite of beating off 7 times a day, he likely said that to throw off his competition. Athletes use every available measure of advantage that they know of to get ahead, which is why steroids are so rampant in the industry. 





So, what exactly would happen if SR were to become mainstream? Well, I'd expect a few things would happen. One thing that would happen would be the explosion of STDs. When birth control first arose in the fifties it started a massive cultural shift that led to the sexual revolution, by the time the seventies hit people were butt fucking in the mud at woodstock. The result is now that STDs are everywhere, and as much as these diseases have become treatable I can't say that I'm glad to have them around. Do we really need a sexual renaissance with regard to SR? I don't think we do, I'd rather not have new strains and novel diseases pop up all over the world, we've got enough already, thanks. Keep in mind that although we have condoms now that doesn't mean we're safe, many countries don't have access to birth control and it's not unprecedented to have a disease show up in a third world country and travel all over the globe. Just look at AIDS, do we really need something new to pop up and spread like the coronavirus just because we couldn't keep our mouths shut about SR and nofap? Another thing that would likely happen is a massive population explosion. Again, we do really need more of this shit? There's enough people on the globe as it is already and I don't think doubling it or tripling it is a good idea. As much as it titillates those who are fearful of decline in white birth rates to have a birthing boom, I'm not quite sure if it would end up having that effect. Birth control is still a thing, as are abortions and morning after pills. All of which are more commonly accessible in first world countries, just because people would be fucking doesn't mean they want or can afford to have more kids. It's more likely that the population boom would go on in third world countries with a lack of access to birth control. Birth rates among races would likely be stable relative to one another. Maybe I'm wrong but regardless I don't see doubling or tripling the current global population as anything but negative, we don't need more useless people farting into the atmosphere there's enough already.





As much as these powers are great to have, I'm not sure that letting everyone know about them is a wise move. I've seen for myself just how it affects people of all types. Young or old. In fact, quite a number of very young girls were attracted to me. I can only imagine what a pedophile would do with this information. Shit is gross and uncomfortable to think about, not everyone should have these powers, I don't trust people to be responsible with them. It's not just people either, it's animals too. I once talked to a girl on the street who was walking her dog. It was a female dog. The dog came up to me, sniffed me and then turned around and started grinding its ass into me. Fucking weird, but I can only imagine how much some zoophile creep would be into that disgusting stuff. Again, not everyone is going to be responsible with these powers. To be honest, I don't even trust your average person to handle my food, let alone these kinds of seemingly magical effects. I think it's a bad idea to tell people about these things. Of course, it's not just strangers and animals, these things also work on family members. Someone with a demented incest fetish could also use this as a technique to fuck his daughter or cousin. The possibilities with SR are vast and I generally find them to be disturbing. Pedophilia, bestiality, incest, orgies, infidelity, all of these things and more would be set on fire all over the world if SR became common knowledge.





Honestly, I think it's only a matter of time before nofap and SR go mainstream. Can't keep the genie in the bottle forever, eventually shit will blow up all over the internet. I don't think it's a good idea for that to happen and I've given my reasoning out to you guys here. You might disagree with me but I thought it was important for others to see this and to at least give it some thought before they decide to open their mouth. This would be an apt time to drop that iconic Spider-Man line about power and responsibility. While SR is a great tool for us to use in our lives, we should exercise caution and reasoning to those we choose to share it with. I don't see a single positive quality arising from telling people about this, but I see quite a lot of downside to it. If you're going to tell someone about it, keep it offline to friends and family members you trust. Personally I don't plan on telling anyone. You can call me greedy or selfish but I don't see what good it would do the world, or myself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/fpiq7z/why_i_believe_sr_should_never_become_mainstream/,Semenretention,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,
Crying out my personal journey,"""It holds the pen that spells the end. It traces me and draws me in."" James Hetfield (Sweet Amber - Metallica)

Listening to songs about addiction. Never used drugs, never smoked or tasted alcohol. Yet I relate.

My time off due to coronavirus has been a grotesque waste of time. All day gaming. PMO every 1-2 days. 

I know what I want to do. But I don't tear myself away. I'm on Reddit instead of sleeping.

Ever since I started masturbating as a teenager, I haven't gone 3 weeks without releasing. 

Ever since I started semen retention (Feb. 2020) I haven't gone 2 weeks without releasing. The last couple of weeks have been terrible as far as semen retention. 

Just wanted to write this. I've always had terrible intrinsic motivation. Just wanted to write this. I'm always lost in my emotions. Mood swings define me. I can't overcome this. I act how I feel. PMO and video games and Reddit are my medicine. 1 hour ago I was two days holding my seed. 45 minutes ago I looked up porn. 30 minutes ago I released. Because I was bored. So 15 minutes ago I made an alarm at midnight that says protect your seed. And I wrote in a notebook 0 days, with the intention of erasing the 0 and writing in a 1, and so on. And then I started writing a short story (writing is my purpose in life) after spending the last few days not doing shit. Laat Friday or so after I relapsed, I made a checklist for things to do involving writing and reading. Now I am on here doom and gloom. It's a fucking roller coaster. I don't know what the end is. 

If I post this it's for attention. I'll be embarrassed by this post tomorrow or a couple days from now. Then delete it. My thoughts have run out now. 

My grades have been the worst ever. I'm so depressed. Extrinsic motivation doesn't mean as much any more. I don't know. I just don't know. I have zero friends. Nowehere to go. I'm normally an A B student. I have a D on my report card. I didn't do some assigmments. I did 25% of the mid term and turned it in.

Coronavirus Vs. Semen Retention,"Does anyone else see the connection between the Coronavirus and Semen Retention?

Even though everyone is freaking out, do you feel more prepared for the virus?

Do you feel like the nourishment you’ve accumulated in your body through SR will somehow give your body an edge if the virus ATTACKS?

It is worth mentioning that even though the virus may effect your body (albeit temporarily), you will still have a sharp mind and spirit. 

You will still be able operate in stability as you realize that the virus is merely a guest in your world. 

You will see that the virus was what it really took to get to slow down enough to observe some things in yourself that need adjusting. 

But answer me this?

How long would this virus even be able to cohabit with the advanced inner intelligence of our immune systems? I would imagine that a smart immune system would be able to identify and fix problems (even new ones) in no time. 

I’m in no way undermining the power of this virus, I’ve just observed that the human body is capable of handling a lot. Even more than what we give it credit for.

I just feel like ranting,"So, as someone who firmly believes in the practice of bramacharya, I'm noticing that for me, just trying to refrain from anything lustful totally removed all of the urges from my body. I now see this stupid world and all its tricks for what they are. I noticed that PornHub is offering a free week to people in Italy who are locked in due to the coronavirus. They are viciously trying to make people think that they need sex to function. I also get sick at looking or hearing mainstream news as it's all stuff to control the weak.

I've had many short streaks of retention, but I had lots of urges during them. But on this one, I feel almost no urges and no manic feelings. I think this is the one where I'll finally get over a month. I've gotten past 10 days with almost no urges before this so I'm pretty confident that I'll get to several hundred days or more on this one as long as I keep on the goals of why I'm doing this.

Be sure to always remember why you're doing something like this which is so esoteric to most people. I'm in my late teens and from talking to more sensible teens and young adults like me, most people are dumb and not going to understand or question their pleasures of self-destruction, or try to lead a philosophical or meaningful life. I noticed it's a lost cause trying to explain this to people, even older, more wise people. I've gotten people saying things like ""you should stop believing stuff on the internet"" and ""ew lol"" in text and the whole prostate cancer thing that they probably read on some popsci page. I at least know for myself it works not just from personal experience, but also because it came from the same yogis and Chinese who would support meditation. And meditation is known to have benefits and is quite mainstream. And I believe the glow is quite real, as I watch a before and after SR video for a you tuber and he didn't even look like the same person. He looks old and mature and I was really surprised that he is only 20.

For me, I know not to be immature and focus on sexual attraction. I focus on improving my self physically, mentally, and spiritually; and also having more energy to workout and enjoy hobbies. I now have replaced lower level activities with working out. And I am getting stronger at a rate faster then I ever have before. I'm also getting more true to myself and finding it easier to socialize. Also, before starting this process, I probably could have been diagnosed with some sort of mood or personality disorder. But now I feel like I can contain all of my energy. I find it really easy now to pull it all up into my body and head and transmute it.

For all of you here on this sub, you're amazing. And for all of you on long streaks, you can probably easily relate to what I'm saying. And now I look back at myself about a year ago thinking of how I used to think that I needed more than I was to be happy, and realize that it's true that happiness comes from within.
